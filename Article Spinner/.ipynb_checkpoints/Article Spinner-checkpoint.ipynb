There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it.  I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion\n",

      "I was considering purchasing a tablet and Wacom was consistantly recommended.  I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line).  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.  Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).  The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard).  Other than that, its an amazing product\n",

The product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot.  But what a surprise.   Just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price.  The pop-up menu thing is cool.  I don't use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place.   I guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around, but I don't seem to use that as much.  I still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around.\n",

      "My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\n",

      "So, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \n",
      "This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\n",

You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk.

      "The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\n",

      "I wouldn't be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That's all there is to it, that's what it does and it does it well. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the down side, and it's a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap, I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "If Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here\n",

      "This is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\n",
      "\n",
      "Get one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!  Throw away your VCRs forever!  Just remember to baby them\n",

      "I bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really, if you're new to this technology, you're not going to have any problems..believe me..A++\n",

      "The other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42\" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I'm sure there's a solution, but just can't figure it out.  Any tips\n",

With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect\n",

      "I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\n",
      "\n",
      "PLUSES: \n",
      "decent sound\n",
      "good functionality\n",
      "easy set-up and intuitive operation\n",
      "simple remote -- but only covers basic functions\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS:\n",
      "very short speaker leads\n",
      "unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\n",
      "only holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality\n",

      "2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.\n",
      "3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this\n",

      "The first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it doesn't come with software for handhleds. That person chose to buy it without and save some $$ and then complained about having to pay extra for it because he/she bought the wrong software package.  Delorme did the right thing and offered us options.  I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so I'm very happy that I didn't have to buy the HH software.  Just don't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it.  Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me, although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option.  Storing 50,000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome.  I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route, elevation, etc.  Too bad it is only in Yellow..\n",

It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. \n",

      "For those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.\n",

      "\n",
      "For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!\n",
      "\n",
      "The negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it's starting to wear out.  But it's still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.\n",

This card is one fast sucker, and it can hold an enormous amount of images. In JPEG mode I am able to store over 1000 images. In RAW mode, which I'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card, I am able to hold 444 images all on my 20D!!! If your thinking of buying this card, don't hesitate. It is one awsome piece of equipment, and one heck of an investment!! \n",

      "These earphones are the best I ever had. I never had to try other pairs of earphone because I absolutely loved these that I keep buying it! After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.\n",

For the money, it has worked flawlessy with Pro compact flash cards up to 4GB in size. I am very impressed with the transfer speeds, and the unit is not too big for traveling. The door that covers the slot, however, is very flimsy and easily deattaches (but fortunately easily reattaches too?) I use Mac OS X 10.4.8 and it works just fine. I also used it with Windows XP without any installation or transfer issues\n",

Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).\n",

      "I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \n",
      "\n",
      "The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.\n",

      "With boys aged 2 &amp; 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I'm driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn't take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children's cds in the car I don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \n",

Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it.

      "I'll try to keep this short and sweet.  If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you've found the right radio for you.  I can't tell you how many pieces of junk I've bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\n",

      "Next, I can't turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.\n",

I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.\n",

      "The reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...\n",
      "\n",
      "I could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Really easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\n",

      "The Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don't get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don't worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you're willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you're looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\n",

      "I listen to a wide range of music, from hard rock, techno/electronic, to classical, and I've found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this -- at least until I ordered this set.  I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I'm very happy with this purchase.  I've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I'd definitely recommend this speaker set\n",

      "Another disappointing factor is that the quality of the video is almost unwatchable if the connection is not robust.  There should be a cache memory built in so that a clear, unchoppy video and sound come through.\n",

In fact, it has more volume, depth, and presence than three other portable speakers--each costing 50 to 75% more--to which I've compared it.  The only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from Amazon, diminishing its \"bargain\" appeal somewhat.)\n",

      "BASS: these don't pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I've heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I'd never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "These obviously can't play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.

      "I think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables.  I wouldn't spend money on the expensive ones.  First of all, I'm not a cable junkie nor an expert.  However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don't know.  But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter.  Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don't buy the expensive ones\n",

      "They have great detail in both low and high end. In fact, I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs, or HQ mp3/AAC, but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...\n",

      "And, yes, they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that, I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE: this procedure is at your own risk, as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  ;-)   Do not overstretch them, as the headband material, while flexible, undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.\n",

      "I bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store, I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD-433 ; HD-437 and HD-457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\n",
      "I do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\n",
      "Overall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\n",
      "When it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\n",
      "Very good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music, DVD movies and games)\n",

      "I am a success coach and I record all my coaching calls as a standard practice. This recorder has performed fantastically in all situations. I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation (depending on battery quality) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls (I have an adapter for the phone). I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use. You would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money\n",

You want the 16x9 profile also, the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios. The newer stuff is very bright and clear.

      "It's not listed in the product description but the Pico works with the iPod Mini too.  Like the other reviewers, I found it easy to setup: tune the radio, turn on iPod, connect the Pico, tune the Pico, done).  In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable, somewhat muted, but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I've read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters, but I am pleased with the Pico\n",

      "I was looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, long lasting, and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter\n",

Shoot if know, but I haven't regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater, particularly DD 5.1 shows.

When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it's home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30's as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT!!!\n",

      "I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier\n",

      "I've had these headphones for just over two years, and I'm happy to see that they're one of the few pairs marketed as \"surround sound\" that have done quite well. The reason behind that is because they're truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You're given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. \n",
      "\n",
      "Movies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you're connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds 'boomier' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does, especially in Gladiator. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I've nothing to complain about. As a college guy, I couldn't bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which, I might add, never sounded as good as my headphones, mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You'd be amazed at Coldplay's \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones. It's indescribable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, I'm a slight audiophile.\n",
      "\n",
      "You seriously can't go wrong with these headphones. And $65 for each additional pair of headphones, allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station? Even better...good idea for families in apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incredibly advanced technology, incredible sound, and incredible results. Can't go wrong here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and they're extremely comfy\n",

      "I just recently purchased the Quickcam STX for my sister who lives overseas in Greece. It's a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis. Surprisingly, the video and audio is quite good. I do have a Mac and she doesn't have any issue calling me from her pc.  We use Aol instant messenger (Video and Audio) or Yahoo Messenger (Video) to connect.  I still prefer the iSight for Macs.  Unfortunately, you can't use an iSight on a pc. Wish Apple could make the iSight compatible with PC's. Anyhow the STX is a great cam for what it's worth.\n",

      "I found the sound fantastic. Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)\n",

      "It plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there, unlike the Belkin (I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci). It is easy to use with the preset FM stations. It works right out of the box, you'll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp, with some static interference, which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car's antenna helps a little but doesn't completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.\n",
      "There is nothing to mount the iPod so you'll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.\n",

      "I have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \n",
      "The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \n",
      "The battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \n",
      "WiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\n",
      "Just about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it's way better)\n",
      "\n",
      "Problems: Don't use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\n",

      "I'm very pleased with this camera.  I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention.  The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.\n",

      "This camera takes great video &amp; photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don't use the face tracking.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.  Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering\n",

Side buttons are very useful. No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.\n",

      "Like most people here, I found the Bose Triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups.  What I found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic.  In fact, the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted, to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic.  Bose replaced them with no hassles, no receipt, no registration, just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago\n",

      "I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\n",

      "Again, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \n",
      "i tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.\n",
      "right now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.\n",
      " one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. \n",
      "I love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too\n",

      "Echoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don't wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it's worth it! And to save your hearing, don't forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\n",

      "This was the largest set that would fit into my space. I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy. The first time, I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It's also quite good on regular TV. \n",

When I called their office for advice, one of the tech guys (excellent service, by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great, not the best or most expensive available, but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful. Add to that the free shipping, no tax and a total price saving of $12.00 and you can't do better than Amazon!\n",

      "This is an awesome little MP3 player.  I enjoy both the MP3 player and the FM radio.  It is very easy to use and syncs well with Windows Media Player.  It is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small.  It came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches.  My only problem with the player is that I can't fit more than 66-69 songs although it says there is about 70MB of space left on the player\n",

      "Yeah, so apparently this was a really good PDA to buy. I BOUGHT THIS THREE YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS! Ive been searching for a new PDA since I thought this one was so out of date, and when reading all the reviews I came across many new \"state of the art\" PDAs that broke after only a few months. This baby has been great to me for three long years, so if you are looking for a reliable buy, go for this. Definately NOT flashy, very basic. All I use it for is appointments, dates, and to-dos. GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO USE A PDA AS AN AGENDA! \n",

      "Netgear clearly has not figured out how to make their RangeMax adapter work well with the Microsoft XP operating system.  If you're not a techie, I'd stay away until Microsoft has certified the WPN311. Here's what I experienced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Installed using the Netgear WPN311 automated configuration.\n",
      "2. After installation completion and boot up, CPU utilization was at a solid 100%.  Executable from Netgear named WLANCFG5.EXE taking up a bunch of the CPU and Microsoft routines CSRSS.EXE, NET.EXE, and NET1.EXE taking the rest.\n",
      "3. Emailed Netgear and received response to use Task Manager to delete WLANCFG5.EXE.  Did so for all users.\n",
      "4. Hey!  CPU utilization returned to normal!\n",
      "5. Sent next email to Netgear pointing out that this solution is just a \"patch\" and WLANCFG5 would return when I re-booted.\n",
      "6. Received response to de-install and re-install software for WPN311.\n",
      "7. Did so, but then Netgear adapter software could not find my MIMO wireless router!  And usage of the Netgear adapter software doesn't allow you to use the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configurator (WZC).\n",
      "8. Went to microsoft.com and looked up error 871122 \"Error message when you try to run the Wireless Network Setup Wizard\" and followed the instruction to allow usage of WZC.\n",
      "9. Then able to add my wireless router and everything is ok.\n",

The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone.  The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly.  If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated. \n",

      "For the background, I've owned &amp; used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Very good bass &amp; well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\n",
      "2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)\n",
      "3. Very light weight\n",
      "4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\n",
      "5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &amp;iM716 have better isolation)\n",
      "6. Moderately priced ($50)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\n",
      "2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\n",
      "3. No pouch or case\n",
      "\n",
      "PS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80's experience :\n",

      "All in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it's physics, there's nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire.\n",
      "\n",
      "I paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\n",

      "I love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\n",

      "These Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100+ years. I'm a professional photographer and it's crucial to store my client's digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come. I've tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data (read errors) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I've burned so far, I haven't had a problem yet. The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub! I have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as Verbatim continues to make a great disc\n",

      "These Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you're safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim's are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I've bought one every couple months and I'm on my 3rd spindle now.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I'm ordering more!\n",

      "Notebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B\n",

It does take a bit of getting used to (after years of movable mouse action) - but it can be done.\n",

      "I am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needed additions:\n",
      "1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have \"radio buttons\" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a 'heart'...\n",
      "2. No station \"scan\" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.\n",
      "3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oddities\n",
      "1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.\n",
      "2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems. Though, unit does work okay with a USB extension cable\n",

      "I have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new iPod.  All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren't the greatest phones I've ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I've ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn't grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g\n",

Sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine run-ups, or idle the APU for hours.

(Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\n",
      "\n",
      "What does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\n",
      "---\n",
      "\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\n",
      "\n",
      "(P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you'll never need them again.\n",

IT has all the things and want and many more, The hand sets are very clear and I love the fact I can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it I do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail. The range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this.  So far I love everything with this phone, It is much better than either of the last two phone I have had. I have walked over a 1/2 block from the house and it still works clearly, I have never had a phone that worked so far away from home\n",

      "I purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \n",
      "\n",
      "My laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I'll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it's really hot in the room, or if I'm running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'd say I'm very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \n",

      "I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should,\" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.\n",

Though the QZ-50's do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20's are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won't eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50's\n",

I use it hooked up to an HP 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner. It took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception. The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football\n",

It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can't smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I'd give this 4-1/2 stars\n",

      "2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don't have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.\n",
      "3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.\n",
      "4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.\n",
      "5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is something about this phone system that I don't like.\n",
      "--The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2,300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.\n",

However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over.

The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright, vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied, they come with the remote and battery. Overall, this printer is the best I have own\n",

Not a single coaster, and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW, the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).\n",

Well, there's no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I'm talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess, but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again\n",

      "First off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \n",
      "i didn't give it five stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp; RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\n",

      "I like this unit. It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box, and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good; I'm very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I've not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. \n",

      "I don't normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won't be disappointed\n",

Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it's still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them.

I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that's how much I love it!\n",

      "I haven't written any reviews for Amazon before, but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball, I had to respond.  I've been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90's when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then, and now it's better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it's worth that.  It's a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you'll be able to use with many computers to come, get this one\n",

      "A couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROS :\n",
      "- incredibly easy to use ( you don't need to teach anybody )\n",
      "- fast for PDF scanning\n",
      "- great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled )\n",
      "- very small, perfect for a desk\n",
      "- good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS :\n",
      "- quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs.\n",
      "- not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents.\n",

      "If you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better. \n",

      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Great sound quality\n",
      "2. Very comfortable\n",
      "3. Light\n",
      "4. Worry-free charging\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy, could require pressing the tune-in button several times\n",
      "2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast\n",
      "3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. \n",

      "I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n",
      " \n",
      "What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\n",

      "Just a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys' before exploring what it is that they're buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\n",
      "\n",
      "a- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software's auto-boot.\n",
      "\n",
      "b- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I'm guessing that those company's that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the 'Uninstaller' on their site.\n",
      "\n",
      "c- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim &amp; Memorex.\n",
      "\n",
      "d- For those who want portable software but don't want U3 or don't have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\n",
      "\n",
      "e- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "g- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent 'roll-back' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn't be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3's, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won't cut it because XP ain't as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software 'toys' that run under 2K, and the 'admin' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys'.\n",
      "\n",
      "h- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you'll have better luck getting what you want, and you won't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "i- When you truly understand the product, you'll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "To one and all, may your 'toys' keep you happy\n",

      "I purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start, I bought only one additional phone. I'll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn't transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \n",

      "I recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "The E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded\n",

      "Noel Lee's Monster Cable products Inc., come up with the goods here! A cable of stunning, high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you'll think you're watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television/monitor, a bold claim indeed, BUT, quite true never-the-less. I was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better. This cable brings to the viewer ALL the picture, and, yes, that does mean \"Warts and all\"so, be prepared to see the smallest of detail, like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work \"Un-seen\". Who really needs HDTV when cables like Monster's MVS3-1M are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television/monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost. Thanks Noel, well done\n",

IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price\n",

My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages, mobile phone down for whatever reason, etc.  This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in.  The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.  Highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house\n",

      "First off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I'm very impressed so far, and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can't complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\n",

      "I'm using this AP, along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn't use the 108Mbps feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network's DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\n",

      "The sound quality is pretty darn good, except that if you pace around while talking/listening, there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite, and, if you stand still they go away.  I've had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around, and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone doesn't do that.  \n",

      "I got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it.  The whole setup works great.  I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone.  That features works well, there's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that's trivial.  I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20' of this base.  I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.\n",

I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn't be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \n",

The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\n",

The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.

      "For reference, I've owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend's ProMedia 4.1's (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500's which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021's which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they're probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\n",
      "\n",
      "Subwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It's very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn't have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don't sound right to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROs:\n",
      "* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\n",
      "* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\n",
      "* Power button on control pod\n",
      "* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they're on, not while they off. 100% silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONs:\n",
      "* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren't always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\n",
      "* Remote is a bit useless\n",
      "* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\n",
      "* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, don't be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn't matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn't pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\n",

      "I've owned these Altec's for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\n",
      "\n",
      "SOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you'll find in any speaker\n",
      "\n",
      "VOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it\n",
      "\n",
      "COMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer's controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\n",
      "\n",
      "SIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\n",
      "\n",
      "PRICE --- believe me - it's a bargain at under $200!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I give my full recommendation here -- you'll love these speakers\n",

      "My sound improvement wasn't as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\n",

      "I wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking, what could be so special about it.  Well, I don't know where to begin.  I like it so much, I'm getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn't care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That's not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn't notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\n",

It's really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it's design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.\n",

Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it's kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement.

Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.\n",

      "I ordered these headphones from Amazon based primarily on user reviews of a number of noise cancelling headphones. I am quite pleased with my purchase. Though not stellar audiophile quality, the sound is pretty darn good, and with some minor EQ it's excellent. The noise cancelling effect seems to work very well: much better than I expected. Furthermore, the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed. I highly recommend them\n",

      "I recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \n",

I would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you don't you will be getting just a black, fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security. This camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming, pan, tilt etc. If you need a simple camera you can't go wrong with the D-link DCS-900 (Wireless or wired version)\n",

      "The keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.\n",

      "I have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here, it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\n",

      "The battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\n",

Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays \"recharge\" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You'll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so\n",

I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you!

      "This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of build, the EB's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all of the UE IEM's in this series, the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's, cord tangling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB's are well-designed and definitely fun\n",

      "This is the 2nd Gamepad I've owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4-button + D-Pad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system, plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this controller.  I've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I've only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\n",
      "\n",
      "The WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFS-MW is very slight but that's not the controllers fault, it's a matter of programming by EA Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the weight of the controller.  It's not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works as well as my old gamepad, but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA, you'll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.\n",

      "CONS:\n",

      "It's not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.\n",

      "I work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\n",
      "\n",
      "The screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know many 5.8 GHz phones don't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone's screen displays the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far I've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I've owned\n",

      "I have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price\n",

      "With so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I'm not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there\n",

The bose quality is very obvious, and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it, which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido.  The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod, and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about, isnt it...?)\n",

I bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of Kodak's photo quality glossy from Costco.  My prints were blotchy.  Then I got my hands on some of Canon's Photo Paper Pro, and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would've thought paper would make this much difference.  I've since bought Canon's 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don't care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\n",

They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.

      "Although I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn't give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can't seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\n",

      "I'm a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.\n",
      "Well, these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any sub-woofer is on the floor close to a corner), as it has a small sized sub-woofer all controls in one the speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These speakers sound really nice, slightly superior sound to Creative's corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative's SBS 350 sub-woofer is larger and more powerful)\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker\n",
      "- No \"wired remote\" (which adds more clutter to your desktop)\n",
      "- Nice design for the price\n",
      "- Even cheaper than Creative's SBS 350\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Small sub-woofer\n",
      "- No \"wired remote\" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close.\n",
      "- No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control\n",

I bought it because, while my Dell laptop backpack is well padded, I wanted to make sure that my Quest 2 GPS was protected \"just in case\". This case fits perfectly, literally like a glove. When I got it, I was sceptical; it looked to small, but I was wrong; the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm, yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket, which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work). All in all, it's another great product from Garmin\n",

      "I purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don't know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it'll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it'll creep out of position a couple inches and I'll have to move it back.  I've seen some comments complaining of that - but I don't see it as a problem since common sense says it won't stay perfectly still since it isn't bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don't recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\n",

      "I got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to \"mold\" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway, it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop, thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber\n",

This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades.  The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD.  The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.  If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood\n",

      "If you've got a Treo 650, You Don't Need A GPS Device.  Simple as that.  The smaller-than-a-small-filet-mignon gps device talks via bluetooth to your 650, which attaches to your windshield via a well-engineered holster.  The charger charges 'em both, or not, as you see fit.  The instructions are clear and to the point.  The installation instructions are slightly out of date - you don't need a card reader to make it happen, after all - and the user experience is, in my case, outstanding.  If you've got a 650 and you ever drive somewhere unfamiliar, BUY IT\n",

      "I bought this paper after my mom gave me a box of Epson 8.5x11 paper she didn't need.  I was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer.  When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive - on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter-sized sheet of paper, that comes to about 20 cents per print, not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper - Epson S041727 - and the price per print was around 12 cents, which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I've found.\n",

Satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times I tried.  The display is excellent under sunny conditions.  Downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple.  I haven't used it yet under driving conditions, so I can't speak to using related features.  Were it damaged or stolen, I'd buy another one without hesitation\n",

      "There are so many times where the actual ink, can be the difference between a good copy, and a not-so-good copy on paper. With HP black ink cartridge #21, it is very convient, and easy to setup into your HP deskjet 3930 series printer. This cartridge is very inexpensive, and affordable for HP printers. I think of it as a must for your HP printers. While there are cartridges that are difficult to open, and install into your printers, this one installs in a snap. I really recommend this for my new HP printer, and so will you if you own a HP printer for this ink as well.\n",

      "Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. \n",

      "I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \n",
      "I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \n",
      "I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \n",
      "I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \n",
      "People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\n",
      "I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\n",

As for the toner itself, Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two  reasons, 1. It's what fits in my printer, and 2. I know when I buy the  C3906A, I am getting what I payed for, a quality cartrige that lasts. One  last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old  one is finished\n",

      "I have some decent mics in my cabinet, as well as a nice preamp, A/D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup.  I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.  Way to go, Samson\n",

      "The 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I've had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a two-line phone that wasn't 2.4Ghz.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn't know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It's a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it's answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\n",

      "The Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic's phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn't work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\n",

      "The 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It's much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\n",

      "This isn't my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \n",

These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\n",

      "If you buy this service plan, print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some notes on the contract:\n",
      "1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
      "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

      "The V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\n",

      "First and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I'd have liked to match it.\n",
      "\n",
      "--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn't disconnect so easily from the Nano that I'd fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn't the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\n",

      "The Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I've always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that's now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it's time to rip everything into lossless format.\n",

      "Having been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n",
      "\n",
      "It gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \n",
      "\n",
      "Can I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Albums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\n",

      "Yes's Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\n",
      "\n",
      "and surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain't broken.  \n",
      "\n",

      "If you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600's that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.\n",

      "Before I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It's very simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn't fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I'm perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there's a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer's \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\n",

      "The HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well. I use it for simple and complex math; statistical analysis and financial analysis. It is much faster and simpler to operate than a PC. My new one has all the same great features. I highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis.\n",

      "I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn't work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. \n",
      "Another nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control\n",

      "After searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I'm so glad that I chose this one.\n",
      "It is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It's a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use.\n",
      "They keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don't use it much. It's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.\n",
      "I really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don't like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can't see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.\n",
      "Aside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.\n",
      "To top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability\n",

I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.

If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5\n",

      "Bought this DVD player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  It has many features and a good picture. You can't beat the large screen. I like the zoom feature especially. Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don't have a bulky protrusion when it's attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You'll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVD-RW or DVD+/- R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.  There is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold \"as-is\" but the unit I got was brand new and not refurbished. So far so good.  I don't thonk you will be disappointed\n",

      "I was really pushing the limits of my mid-range Monster surge protector with 2 TVs, a 2.4Gig P4 with desktop TV, DSL, two printers, and .....drumroll please.....a fridge all crammmed into a  corner office setup about 7' wide. The Belkin Gold unit with RF/EMI suppression up to 75db cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers, satellite signal, the \"dirty\" line into my modem, and a week later I haven't had to reboot my system once. Amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had already had a great experience with a Belkin SurgeMaster on my Home Theater setup, so I went one level up with this \"Gold\" unit. One of the better investments I've made lately. I paid $60 at the local Office Depot, the price Amazon is advertising is ridiculously low at $35. Belkin.com's price is about $70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at Amazon wakes up  and jacks the price.\n",

      "I bought this recorder to use as backup for real-time event video recording.  I have also used it concert settings.  The record quality is astounding, full range of dynamics, using both the stereo mini-plug input and the 1/4\" inputs.  It is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio.  First thing I did was to upgrade to a 4GB Compactflash card.  The provided card is too limited.\n",

      "\n",
      "It all works as advertised.  The only minor glitch I have had, is that when you first try to start a recording, it gives a \"media full\" message, even tho the media is empty.  Then you select record again and it records just fine.  I went several iterations with Tech Support, who were very friendly and helpful, but the problem has not been resolved.  I also suspect the 3rd part flash card may be contributing to this glitch.  I would buy this recorder again\n",

      "I was looking for something suitable to house my sansa, and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb, looking sharp, snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way, I suppose, it wouldn't be able to fall off\n",

      "While thinking of ideas for my church's 75th anniversary celebration, I  decided to make T-shirts and sweatshirts using iron-on transfers and my ink  jet printer. I chose the \"invent it!\" brand from Hammermill  papers because it was the most cost-effective (cheapest). I created the  design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper. The results  were outstanding for a do-it-yourself project. I followed the instructions  included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake. One thing that I  did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact. This product also does a very good job in black and white, not  just in color. The shirts that I did, laundered according to the  instructions, came out of the wash lookin' good. I won't hesitate to use  this product again in the future. However, I am now having trouble buying  it locally, since my previous source no longer handles this product\n",

      "We purchased the YSP-1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wall-mounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipment!\n",
      "\n",
      "When we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space). \n",

The best feature is that they do NOT leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you.  This is perfect for an ipod-using NYC subway rider.   Don't want to annoy others by leaking sound, but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise, at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what's going on.\n",

      "I tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the E3C's, but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor, and they were uncomfortable.  The yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications.  They effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable.  Although they seem a bit expensive I've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them.  Just soak, squeeze, rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new.  You can do this three or four times, then just toss them away.  \n",

      "Once THE speaker of choice for every hard rockin' audiophile with a big enough garage, Klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn't know the real value of what they'd bought.  But after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles, Klipsch is back on top, from a sound quality standpoint -- and it shows in the ProMedia 2.1 THX.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have my trio connected to a new Mac Pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical.  Yes, there are more complex set-ups, with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room, but if you just want the magic without the madness, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are other 3-speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech, Cyber Acoustics, and Intec, but here's the difference: Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer, while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose, Harman Kardon, JBL, and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end, while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great, but are more expensive.  So, after a good look (and listen) around, I went with Klipsch.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, this is an incredible sound set-up for your computer-based music player and should not be overlooked.  Enjoy\n",

I used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through, and the results were amazing. The picture quality is crystal clear, even when almost all of the ports are in use, and the internet is blazing fast. Compared to the set-up we used to have, with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier, these pieces are WELL WORTH THE SMALL EXTRA COST\n",

The sound is extremely clear and crisp, whether it be music or games, and I am very pleased with them.  The only downside to them is how many extra cords there are behind my desk, but you have to expect that with a 5.1 sound system\n",

The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others' reviews, you can't read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.

I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again, I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.

If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock\n",

No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click \"Apply\" and you're good to go a-browsin'!!\n",

      "Until an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound, these were my favorite pair of earphones. They were comfortable (I often left them in when I went to sleep), affordable, lightweight, durable, and had good sound quality. I used them with my Sony CFD-V5 boombox, my Oritron OP5034 portable CD player, and my RCA RP2410 MP3-CD player. On all three, bass and detail was great, and there was no distortion at a higher volume. All in all, these earphones were a great value; the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound, which I got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones (it lent a bit of warmth to the music). I plan to buy another pair in the near future, and I highly recommend that you do so as well\n",

      "I received it today, and it's a monster.  If you've seen one in a store, it looks twice as big on your desk.  Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP, I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides, I didn't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).\n",
      "\n",
      "To my great relief, the monitor worked on the card right away, even showing me the POST and Windows start-up screen (it did for the 20\" displays, too).  But to my absolute delight, the card is actually running both the 30\" and a 20\" in 32-bit color.  The 20\" looks absurdly small next to the 30\", like I didn't water it enough or something.  The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I'm just sitting too close.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20\" plug to fit it below the 30\".  I'm not a gamer, so I can't say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The screen had a slight warm cast that I didn't like.  Nvidia's control panel let me adjust it manually, and now my 30\" and 20\" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks, this is the third panel I've gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once, and it does a fine job at that.  I'm using the 20\" for browsing and, alas, a few panels that STILL don't fit.  Apple, where's 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it's crazy expensive.\n",

However, she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways.

      "I just recently bought a Sony DVP-S560D model DVD player to replace my  older, more out of date player. I hooked it up, and to my surprise, it  wasn't any better than my old player as far as quality. Then I purchased  S-Video cables from Monster Video and now the colors are more vibrant, the  picture is in higher-res, and I can see every little detail on the screen.  The picture quality that these S-Video cables produce are surpassed only by  component video cables, which cost many times more the price. If you are  considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of  only one DVD, you can get better performance and picture quality\n",

      "I love sound systems. So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product\n",

      "This is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune.\n",

      "I did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse.  I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable.  At home, I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received it today, and I'm on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway).\n",
      "\n",
      "- I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size.\n",
      "\n",
      "- I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response, very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "- USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out, not so hard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe\n",

      "I have to admit, I'm a GPS junkie.  I've had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user interface is very easy to use.  I've used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin's is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "One highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - \"let your fingers do the walking...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn't know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin's MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked!  So now I have the c340's excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit's WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog.  Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it\n",

Those of you who are interested in wardriving should look elsewhere. If you want to use netstumbler or pocketwarrior in windows or kismet and airsnort in linux, either go for the linksys wcf12 (prism based) or lucent orinoco based pcmcia card. if you're looking to run just 802.11b and check email, stream music, browse the web, etc, this card will be perfect plus it'll save you some battery power\n",

      "Great quality.  I had a problem initially with XP Media Center compatibilty, but it works now after downloading an update from Logitech's website.  Recently, the sound is cutting out when communicating with my girlfriend across the country.  I think it might just be her interet connection though (we both have the same web cam).  As long as we restart the video call, then the sound comes back.  I am using Windows Live Messenger as the video call program.  I have never used the cartoons that it comes with.  The video quality is very good when recording a video for email\n",

      "There's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&amp;LOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVD-Audio discs.\" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVD-A's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A's, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you'll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\n",

      "I've had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes, resolutions, etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing B-size (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like just about every review states, this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don't print many color photos this is not a problem for me--if I was doing that I'd get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I've researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. \n",
      "\n",
      "My main complaint with this printer--and the reason why it only gets four stars--is the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\n",

      "Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\n",

      "I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n",

      "What a wonderful surprize.  It took about ten minutes to install them to my HP Media center computer.  They replace speakers that came with my 19\" monitor which were lousy to say the least. (speaker make with held) But the vs 4121s surpassed all my expectations.  While I am not an audiophile, I do admire and expect good faithful sound reproduction and these speakers more than do the job.  I don't understand how the more expensive ones can do any better.  Suffice to say I am completely satsfied and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for their moneys worth\n",

      "This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5\n",

      "Earlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\n",
      "Note to the technosavy: I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites, so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also, the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out, so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this, you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  \n",
      "Note 2: the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable, a 20-30 dollar value that many don't come with\n",

      "BREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dock basically serves three purposes:\n",
      "- The traditional synch &amp; charge function available since the early days.\n",
      "- It helps you get \"Line\" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.\n",
      "- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends &amp; family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the \"Apple iPod AV Cable\" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box\n",

I rebooted, and everything was detected and has worked fine since.  So just remember to reboot after installation. \n",

      "I am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys. I bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out. I first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome. i could hear things in songs i have never heard before. I then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like. to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp. There was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good. the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you. I am glad i got these instead of the 650's cause my friend owned the 650's and if you don't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck\n",

      "I'm very happy with this model. I use it mostly as a VCR replacement to record broadcast TV shows. You can't beat the price for this feature-set. I'll try to describe some aspects that aren't mentioned in the other reviews. The owner's manual can also be found online in PDF format.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can schedule upto 16 programs. It does not support VCR+ or a TViO-style program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough, but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint: The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet, the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting, only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk, the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The four-hour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flex-mode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the -RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media, but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison, but this unit can play and record on them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Watching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording, but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well, but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "One interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using, the signal is sent through the s-video output.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star\n",

I plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound.  I have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable.  That connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop.  After switching around the cables I had a picture again.  I can't really see an improvement in the picture quality (HD is beautiful) I bought the monster basically for the protection\n",

      "The 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about  0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970's series of the HP hand held calculators\n",

      "I am giving this product 4 stars. Why? Because there is only ONE ethernet port. If you have a router, just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go. If you do not have a router, consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4-port router. There are several.\n",

      "Installation on a normal home network setup is very easy. My setup was a little more complex due to voip router, and 2nd wireless router. Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. \n",

I'm running the Sling AV with Netgear Ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching TV via wireless to my laptop. Now we can watch TV in any room of the house.

      "I bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint.  I use it in Chicago.  A lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal, not true at all.  I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds.  It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.\n",
      "Overall, this GPS works perfectly.  The auto-reroute is fantastic, it is very quick to recalculate my route if I miss a turn, and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn. You will not be disappointed with this purchase\n",

      "Soundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be.  The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted.  The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn't be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8\" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you're going to have to go elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.  If you can't spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good, however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don't bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness, do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers, you won't even notice the difference\n",

      "I hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).\n",
      "The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.\n",
      "Edit: I bought it for $20, but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don't buy this for your 5G iPod unless you're already sure or can try it before you buy it\n",

      "I have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now. The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. \n",
      "\n",
      "Look, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always \"resize\" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space. Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "You never know. I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things. I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park. If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!\n",
      "\n",
      "Matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea. No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems. They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer. They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable. I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality. If you want quality buy SONY\n",

      "I've used the iTrip by Belkin, the TunecastII by Belkin, and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\n",

A 30gb hard drive as in the iPod 30g (that my son has) is subject to air pressure, shock and temperature domain that a flash memory device will not be subject to.  Because the hard drive spins to lift the heads above the disk, moisture from condensation will cause the head to crash if, brought in from a cold car and turned on.  I do not know about the iPod but some larger devices have dew point detector that will not spin up unless the air in the device is at safe temp.\n",

      "I purchased a Sony WEGA 27 inch tv. I took advantage of it's rear component input labeled video4.  I connected my Sony DVP360 Dvd player.  With dvd viewing, the movie Dinosaur, Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2, and Vegas Vacation, the colors were very vibrant, details were dynamic, and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution. I have viewed these same movies on larger screen HDTV's such as the Pioneer Elite and was disappointed??? Glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture. I can't imagine that I can do any better for my television than these cables.  I am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my Sony WEGA with these Monster component 3 cables\n",

      "A sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop.  I took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the Kensington Contour.  I didn't want to buy a Kensington.  I wanted a backpack making company with a name I knew, like Jansport,or Kelty.  I've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products.  I settled on the Kensington because it had the qualities I was seeking: comfort, quality materials and design, water proofing, laptop padding, urban black, rugged exterior, sophisticated appearance, lots of pockets, adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket.  I write and work in media for a living.  Mostly I work at home, but once a week I travel to cities.  This pack does exactly what I want it to do - have places for everything I need, protect my precious laptop, and look hip.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So now it is a few months later.  I still like my pack, but twice now the hardware has broken.  The first time it was just the zipper-handle on the little outside pocket. It fell off.  Kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free.  Last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap-- broke when slung the pack across my back. I haven't contacted them yet\n",

Just did a 1.26GB transfer that took 140 seconds.  I was a big leery of the included software, but was pleased to see that if I didn't care for it, it was easily removed.  I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive, and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract.  This is a very good drive, and contrary to the negative comments, I would encourage anyone looking for a fast, stylish, practical jump drive to seriously conside the Titanium Cruzer\n",

      "Let me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Command Pad: Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some, but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrl-alt-delete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be \"impossible\" and \"buggy\" seem to be computer illiterate at best, and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews, possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keyboard: The quietness, response, and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment, and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.\n",
      "\n",
      "*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last and probably least comes the aesthetics, of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value.  \n",

It is impossible to remove and difficult to use.  A better belt clip would make this the perfect skin.  This is a very good price from TechGNet. \n",

      "I have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.\n",

      "I got the newer model of these, with the blue light on the speakers . All I can say is that these speakers are worth the money. You get what you pay for. These speakers have pretty good highs in them, bass wise there decent. They hit alright, and sub decent. You pay more money, you get a better system you know. This system here isn't much money, so it isn't going to be the best. So there isn't no reason for the bad reviews. I think they work really good for the price their tagged at. So if your looking for a system with some good highs, and decent bass these are for you\n",

      "I bought a 32 inch 5 years ago.  in 2003 when movie I was trying to move it across the room and it flipped face first in the floor.  Mind you I had paid like $200 for Sear's sorry 3-5 year? warranty and it turned out they wouldn't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there.  I heard a sickening crash (like the picture tube/glass breaking).  It still works and only has a dent it the top left.  I think I got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again.  Not a big deal since I have a directv remote,but I forgot I even had PIP because of no remote.  From now on if I can afford it I will buy sony only.  I bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that I never use\n",

      "This TV weighs a ton, took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire. I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27\" Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27\" Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36\" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound, but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire\n",

      "This monitor stand is worth every penny, and considering the price, that really isnt that many pennies.  What a monitor stand does is it raises the monitor to make it easier on your neck to view.  I have an IBM laptop and I place it on top of the stand.  With the stand, I probably have to look down at most about 10-15 degrees.  Before the stand, I would have to look down at about 35 degrees.  This does not seem like much, but if you spend alot of time staring at a computer screen, your neck will be sore.  Buy this stand and your neck will thank you. \n",

I still give the case a 4 star rating, because I am a soldier in Iraq, and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my IPOD clean.

      "I agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead\n",

      "I purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. \n",

      "I've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They've included Koss \"The Plug,\" Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I've had to a good balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn't as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here's an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that's as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don't use these pads, so I don't think they're really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm satisified, especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way, don't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet! A separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries, so yes, it is covered\n",

      "I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!         \n",

      "I bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because I trust Toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained.  We haven't had any problems with the mechanics of the player.  We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination.  Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly.  My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.  But, my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway, so it wasn't that big a deal for us. \n",

Most of the others had so-so features or bad enough reviews that made me pass on them; however, with the 5-star review and Cuisinart name, I chose the TOB-30BC.  It toasts, it bakes, it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital. Overall, it's a great oven and we have no complaints with it's cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit; but less than a month later, one of the knobs broke off the unit. They are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening. My hubby sent an email to Cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob, but one would have expected better engineering from a name like Cuisinart\n",

      "I've purchased several Logitech mice(cordless optical)and I've been satisfied with all of them, except for the battery life.  I had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month.  This new Logitech mouse is terrific.  It's been several months and I have not had to change the batteries yet ... and I am not even using the on-off switch (I want to test the battery life without the switch first).  Battery issues aside, the mouse is smooth, light and accurate.  It was simple to install and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat\n",

      "I bought this headset and I must say it's a great buy. First off it's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams. It's small which definately helps when your wearing it around. At times it's like you don't even feel liek your wearing anything. Exactly how a headset should be. I've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires. The only problem I have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset. Not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones. But that a small price to pay for such a great, inexpensive headset like this one\n",

      "Overall, I like this surge protector and would buy it again. I bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets, six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick-style transformer plugs. I did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration, and this unit always came up.  It has worked just fine for the month or so I've owned it. I particularly appreciate the angled plug, which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only have two quibbles with the APC--the color and the stiffness caused by the plug-activated safety shutters.  Plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters, which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or hard-to-reach location.  On a much more minor note, the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against light-colored walls and carpets, even when tucked behind a desk.\n",

Horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two. So I bought this headset and I have been quite pleased with it. The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I'm talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset.\n",

      "There are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\n",
      "I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\n",
      "As a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don't work for or invest in them ;-\n",

      "I bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I've owned the Sony MDR-V600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\n",

I'm hoping they will be able to make the phone more compatible with Starbucks and hotel wi-fi. That would make the phone perfect.

When they are wound up in their little yellow case, the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don't offer such security.\n",

Pocket PCs especially seem prone to this, as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors\n",

Radio reception is good; I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That's mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.  \n",

      "I have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them, and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bad: Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I'm not using it, because you can forget it's there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought mine at Target, where they were labelled $24.99, on \"clearance\" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another \"clearance\" price), I bought a second pair as a backup. I'm glad I did -- I'm still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don't know how many hours I get, but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day, listening to podcasts and audiobooks\n",

      "I purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud, if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Build quality is \"ok\". I got the white speakers and they are the nice \"Mac\" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  \n",

      "As you may already know, this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these Panasonic models: KX-TG2700/KX-TG2720, KX-TG2730/KX-TG2740. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Panasonic KX-TGA271V, does not need (or use) a telephone jack. It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the \"MUTE\" button on my base unit and then press the \"PLAY\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone!) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are: finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone, the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KX-TG2730 has a digital answering machine, and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well) ---- THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE, YES THE KX-TGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT!!!, a separate \"call waiting\" dedicated button is also included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this phone will use any standard headset, it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone! \n",
      "\n",
      "Please know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KX-TG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also, the KX-TG2730 phone can't be charged in this charger, and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KX-TGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less. \n",
      "\n",
      "The face of the phone is white with a purple trim. The back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half. The \"white\" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white, and the \"purple\" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KX-TG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat, it is indented slightly, and bordered in silver. \n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.), however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work! \n",
      "\n",
      "Panasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However, this is still not a perfect solution. So, I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones, and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info\n",

      "I recently bought an HP 17\" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "This case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17\" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd's in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).\n",
      "\n",
      "This bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5'1\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great, if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "happy buying!\n",
      "ps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17\" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.\n",

      "I've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I've owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small, portable MP3 players that has it's own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip, where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big gripes I've seen repeated in the other reviews are:\n",
      " 1) Poor radio reception.\n",
      " 2) No Bass from the mini speakers.\n",
      " 3) Short Battery life.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) I never use this to listen to the radio, so I won't comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio's on the market so if you need a radio, go buy a radio.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room, it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 30-35 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel, the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it's buffer then spins down until it needs more data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway I wanted to toss in my two cents, as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners, and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It's my hope that we'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit. But bottom line, I've got my monies worth, and if anyone doesn't want theirs, I'd be glad to take it off their hands.\n",

      "I researched cases upon receipt of my 20 GB iPod and deemed this the best.  This case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear, hard shell.  The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs.  It also does not obscure the screen.  An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit.  \n",
      "This case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case.  Also, Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves.  I spent $5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case.  \n",
      "The price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 GB iPod. \n",

      "The profiler software is excellent, allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse.  This allows you to play any game with the controller, even ones which don't naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell.  With the \"shift\" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad.\n",

This made the D-pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter, but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway\n",

      "First, I should say that I'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, and I'm not sure what that means, but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung's own 20.1\" non-widescreen model).  Everything is crystal-clear, which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming - Half-life 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004, for example, both look great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its wide-screen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 4:3 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen), so if you have any games or other applications that don't support widescreen modes, you can use 4:3 mode so that the picture doesn't look stretched and distorted.  Plus, the monitor has DVI, analog VGA, S-Video, and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees, and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a flat-panel display, it is also lightweight and compact, which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flat-panel display, and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these features, especially the sharp image, make this a great monitor, and it is worth the money\n",

      "I have used mine for over six months and it works without a hitch. A nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you don't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard. Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism. Others may run into this problem. The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles. A minor hitch but not earthshaking.\n",

The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it's about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal. Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit. I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home. So far I'm happy that I bought it\n",

      "This case is a veritable dirt magnet.  It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk.  However, it protects very well.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However, it doesn't even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn't bother me, because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also, the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough, and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod, so I do not know how those would fare).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on.  It protects well, and you never have to take it off, even to plug it in.  I would recommend it, though it is a bit pricy.    \n",
      "\n",
      "In a bit of an update, with this case on, my iPod survived a ferret attack, with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case.  I think this case is well worth the money.  My iPod could have been destroyed, but it's perfect\n",

      "We bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago.  One handset gave us problems from the start, but was promptly replaced when returned for service.  The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.  I like the features, including paging system, call transfer, and handset speakerphone.  Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus.  I think the sound quality is very good, and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive.  I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.\n",
      "Overall I feel it works as advertised, and we'll be using it for a long time\n",

The only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice-into both directories.  Oher than that, this is a GREAT phone.  I have owned panasonic and GE cordless phones in the past and had problems.  I even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone. \n",

The packaging didn't mention Nano so with a bit of trepidation I plugged it into the wall and my iPod and my Nano liked it!  Charging happened - it must have been made before the Nano came out.

      "I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n",

I don't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because I have enough space down there and all I have to is lean down...  Anyway I personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud (considering its computer speakers) I don't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when I'm in the shower so I am pretty much happy with them\n",

      "I needed new computer speakers after my Cyber Acoustics died after only 3 months. SO i wasn't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast. I use a Mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers, but couldn't decide to go with either the Sound Sticks, Creatures, or these. Well since i am saving up for a new Laptop, i wanted to save as much money as possible. Plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they STILL work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance. Well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to Max and Sub base up to Max. (Yes i underestimated these speakers) When i turned a song in in iTunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair! I was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume, and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk! \n",

      "Moral one:  Do not underestimate speakers my good brands even with low wattage.\n",

      "I highley suggest these speakers for people who don't have much to spend or don't want to spend alot of money. If you want better quality i would go with Sound sticks or Creatures. But these look like they will serve me well\n",

Most of my printing is borderless 8 1/2x11 and the quality is always great. Definitely worth it.  If turnaround time is a problem, buy two so you always have a spare.\n",

      "Operation of the Sony DVPNSS550/B single disc DVD player has been straight forward.  Picture quality is very good, and the desired basic features have functioned without problems.  In other words, in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player, quality and reliability have been high.  Price too was very reasonable.  That means durability is the last quality to consider, which is why I have given the player a 4 rather than a 5.  There is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years.

      "As long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second, they don't have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally, plenty of sound escapes.  So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral.  \n",

Put your iPod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong, and order these (or if you don't want to fork out $40, order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these, and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range.) \n",

The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it.

      "The KOSS Pro-4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's).  Also, they require a 1/4\"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators &amp; attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEGATIVES:\n",
      "1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones)\n",
      "2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size' is greater than 7 1/2.\n",
      "3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\n",
      "\n",
      "POSITIVES:\n",
      "1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA's is almost impossible to beat.\n",
      "2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\n",
      "3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\n",
      "4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA's for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they're not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.  If you just want 'jogging/exercise music', then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA's are still the best choice around.\n",

My only problem is that at times, I will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom, but it won't seem to turn off! I reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again, and this always does the trick. Other than that, very ergonomic, extremely smooth and precise.\n",

      "I like the solid feel of a slightly weighty mouse, and with the batteries, this mouse feels just right. If only it weren't for the mouse not turning off sometimes, I'd give it a 5\n",

This resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1/4\" and made the viewing unpleasant. The screen also wasn't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100%. Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say, quality control missed this one.\n",

The built-in speakers leave less than desired and useless. \n",

The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily.

      "\"Cobra's NAV ONE 4500 and Garmin's StreetPilot 2720, which each sell for $800 to $1,000, use a more straightforward approach. The traffic info travels along with FM radio broadcasts from Clear Channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets. An FM antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system.\"\n",

      "\"I preferred the Cobra, mostly for its big, bright 5-inch screen and its built-in radio receiver. (The Garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio.) When you encounter traffic, a pop-up on the screen and a voice give you three options: Keep driving, reroute me, or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one.\n",

      "I've owned this headphone for about a year now, and I've got to say, after going through multiple headphones, this beats all others I've tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon), I'll surely buy another one again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses, you won't feel uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it's single wire format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all I've got to say, and overall, this headset is definitely worth your money\n",

I got it for Christmas, and now for $20, you can't beat that. I use a standard charger for it in my car, so I never have to worry about batteries. It seems that the best way to get it to sound the best, is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using (equalizer). I have also used it on my portable DVD player in the car and it sounds awesome! For the price, I highly recommend this product\n",

Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.\n",

Yes, it would draw down batteries more quickly, but as an option it would be user selected.\n",

I like to play Solitaire and read text files on my nano, so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if I didn't use the screen so much.  TuneJuice means I don't ever have to worry about that again.  I just keep a couple of 9V batteries with me, and I can keep listening, playing, reading or whatever on my nano as long as I want.  Love it.\n",

      "Now, about 5 months after first receiving the TuneJuice, I'm about to order my second one - to replace the first one.  I still love it, and did get a *lot* of use out of it, but snapping 9V batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the 'snaps' that connect to the battery itself to break off. Despite that, I feel like I got my money's worth and I'm buying another one\n",

I have a Yamaha RX-V2700 receiver which has HDMI hookups.  I tried a HDMI cable that came with my DirecTV box (from my Toshiba HD DVD player) and it was seriously lacking. This hookup is MUCH better!  I have a Monster Cable HDMI hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my Sony 46\" flat panel as well (more $ but....).  I'm finally satisfied.  I'm watching (and listening to) \"Batman Begins\" (In True HD sound) on HD DVD and it is superb!!!!  This is just awesome!  The stuff of fantasy.  You only have to buy this/these cables once, so why not buy the BEST?!  I highly recommend this move. \n",

I had a couple of \"glitches\" (buttons that didn't work quite right) when I first programmed the device, but the Harmony support team helped me through those areas. The changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the Harmony web site so if I ever need to, all I have to do is reload the info.\n",

I've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle (out of two that come with it) still looks almost full. If the price was a little more consumer friendly I'd give it five stars. I mean come on. When you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50-pack of CD-R's for less than $14, the profit margin on something like this is probably 200% or more\n",

While my laptop can be used to type, when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable.  This keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing.  The bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if I would like without stopping the connection.  I would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it.  Overall, a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier\n",

      "I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great\n",

      "\n",
      "I bought this to replace the corded version of the same item. The cordless works as well as the corded one. The trackball doesn't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did, but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use.\n",

      "I find the shape of the Logitech Trackman to fit the hand very naturally. It is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse, which is why I use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use. This is for home use with multiple users, with different mouse location preferences. I took the corded one to use at work, where it still performs flawlessly 8+ hours a day.\n",

      "- I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor. I found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably. This is a documented requirement in the owners manual, but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless. The receivers, as stated earlier, take up space I would rather not spare\n",

      "We have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer.  It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office.  For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel.  It's not a small, USB stick that goes in the back.  It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.  I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel.  All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me\n",

      "If you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some notes on the contract:\n",
      "1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
      "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

But 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem. Range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the Rocky Mountains. It's a great way to stay in touch when traveling. The batteries are rechargeable, both A/C &amp; D/C. The ear pieces were very good for privacy. Very easy to use and well worth the price. A good investment.\n",

      "I was hesitant to get this, since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  Now that I bought it, I'm very glad I have it.  It does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you're trapped in a building), AC, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\n",
      "Only minor criticisms:  The case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn't hold the AC adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\n",
      "Overall, this is all you should need for light, siren, and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster\n",

      "I just recieved my HDMI cable and am very impressed. The price is just what it should be about $5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over $100 for this cable at a store. The service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days! I highly recommend this cable. I just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the TV and WOW what a great picture all around. The color is just so much more vivid using HDMI compared to component 3 wire connectors. Get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others\n",

      "The SanDisk 1GB Micro SD Card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging.  I installed it in my Motorala RAZR V3m as expanded memory for my music library.  Be sure to remove the RAZR battery to clear the access slot for the Micro SD.  The V3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems.  I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access \"My Music\" using menu function #3 under \"Get Tunes &amp; Tones\".  Function #6 \"Manage Music\" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.  The SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the V3m as cell phone with \"MP3\" player\n",

      "Okay so it was about 8:45 at night. I was coming on to a 1/2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where I live. I was doing 60mph, the speed limit is 40. As I start to approach the bridge I start getting a small K-Band warning. I instantly slow down to the speed limit. As I start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so I slow down even more to 35 mph. Then it gets to full K-Band. I look to my left where there is a service parking area, and in the pitch dark I see the reflectors of the one and only Crown Vic Police Car. As I pass the police car, I start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead.  \n",

      "This is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I'm not maniac driver. The detection range is very good, it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won't help much, I have it turned off. Overall, it's very good detector, you will get payback if you own one. \n",

      "I got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below (followed exactly).  There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work.  Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.  Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5, this is what worked for me at any rate.\n",

      "\n",
      "From S Huff: The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working... but I still had some issues. I've added onto his tips from his review below \n",
      "\n",
      "1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP \n",
      "2-Hold the auto-configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 10-15 secs. \n",
      "3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander), a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). \n",
      "4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired &amp; save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) \n",
      "5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. \n",
      "5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. \n",
      "6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. \n",
      "7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you're DONE. Enjoy \n",

      "I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.\n",
      "As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product\n",

      "\n",
      "I bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.\n",
      "\n",
      "On with the review:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good!). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn't too loud &amp; I can live with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer\n",

      "I picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight).  Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses).  Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding.  My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650.  1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones)\n",

      "It is remarkable that, even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence, none of them are near-perfect.  I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available.  I couldn't find it in any store, and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers.  I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do, don't order from the iSkin company directly.  I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.  They should re-dedicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them\n",

      "I tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven't used so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all - for webcams, I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I've generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech.\n",

      "Garmin iQue M5\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The car mounting bracket works fine.  It's popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.

Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...]  We've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won't wear out too quickly, as I've heard Palm Pilots tend to do.

      "We bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile.\n",

You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod.\n",

Anyways, this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times (more than enough for my flight sims). Movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution hasn't been a problem. The design is probably the neatest looking out there (subjective I realize).

      "My favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers (1-xxx-xxx-xxxx) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call.  My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxx-xxx-xxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first.  This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number.  I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in.  Very handy.  As far as being a phone, it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it\n",

      "Ok.. here's the deal.  I've been an avid Magellan user for the past 3 years.  I love my Magellan.  I've never liked the Garmins because of their clumsy interface (the buttons placed above the display NEVER made sense to me) and how the menu structure was built.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However.... We're planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast.  We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time.  My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day.  I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me, it was torture).  I could go on and on about why I sent it back.  \n",
      "What I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx.  Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side.  \n",
      "I couldn't be happier with my decision.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps, and the expense of additional ones, this unit ROCKS!  It acquires satellites within seconds.  It has expandable memory.  It has a color screen.  It manages Geocaches.  It auto-routes.  It stores 1000 waypoints.  It has SiRF Technology.  It is a USB interface.  It has a belt clip.  It changes display contrast at night (automatically).  It slices...  It dices....\n",

      "I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \n",
      "\n",
      "It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod\n",

      "- Bluetooth - connects immediately; provides smooth accurate tracking\n",

      "I'm a skeptic. No, I mean I'm REALLY a skeptic... especially in today's marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don't buy anything without checking it out first, and even then, I expect that it's probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah, wonderful view there, huh?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn't fail me out of the box. I've been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that's how well this gamepad has worked for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the ins and outs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I've never had it happen since. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Other buttons. \n",
      "* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n",
      "* The orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n",
      "* I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that's not much of a complaint at all, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "The d-pad itself is a godsend! I'm a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed - a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn't it? \n",
      "\n",
      "The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for the type of benefits I've listed. And, for that matter, I'm recommending it right now in fact...\n",

      "The antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the GPS units internal antenna. This easily solved the issue of poor reception when the GPS is inside of a car; however, the best accuracy I am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs. the 9 feet using the GPS's internal antenna when in an open area.  Garmin's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around (on my GPS).  I feel the antenna was worth purchasing\n",

      "Since there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs, I recommend you get this one.  Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).  The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality.  The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there. A solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available\n",

I like that it's not huge and doesn't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that I never use. The rechargeable mouse is handy as well. Prior to this, I had two Microsoft wireless combos in a row, and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me. I don't know if it's because it's Logitech or it's bluetooth, but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired (after they \"wake up\").\n",

The main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger, with a couple walls in between, and I have no problems with signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The handsets are smaller than I expected, but that's actually a bonus since I hadn't bought a new phone in a while and thought my old handset was too big and clunky.  The handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part, 1 and 7/8 inches at the widest point by the display, and 1 and 1/8 inches thick at the thickest point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics.  I've used the phone while sitting next to my laptop, while both I and the chargers were next to TV and stereos, and with my cell phone going at the same time - no interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speakerphone part isn't that great - the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room, plus they say it sounds like I'm speaking from a great distance away.  But I've never had a phone with a good speakerphone, so wasn't expecting that to work anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would have been great if they'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks.  I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet - solved my lack of working jacks problem!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys.  The keys are not backlit.  The menus are fairly intuitive - if you've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily.  It's very easy to send phone numbers that you've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first hooked everything up, the phones got no dial tone, but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall.  For some reason, the cord they provided didn't work, so when I swapped it out with the cord I had, all the phones worked fine.\n",

      "This is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands. It is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely, even if you are left-handed. The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse. I can't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one\n",

      "This is an excellent product. If you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you.  I am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day. I have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places. The Garmin GPS 18 plugs right into the USB port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments.  I'll admit \"NROUTE\" took a little getting used to (for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you're not going to find it) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie.  Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.  A great buy for only 100 bucks! If you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of GPS, dont spend $500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome GPS sensor for only $100\n",

      "I have the Canon MP500 printer and Canon Rebel XT camera - both capable of producing amazing results, but paper makes a HUUUUGE diference in photo printing. I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. \n",

Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive \"Pro\" paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the \"Pro\" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)\n",

I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\n",

Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\n",

      "So, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \n",
      "This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed.

It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price.

I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap, I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\n",

Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\n",

      "One of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\n",

Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.

      "I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).\n",

One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton.

Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice.

      "With boys aged 2 &amp; 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I'm driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn't take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children's cds in the car I don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n",

If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \n",

Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.

As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.

I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.

The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don't worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer).

I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\n",

I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use.

My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.

      "I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier\n",

      "I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\n",

If you don't wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.

Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n",

GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO USE A PDA AS AN AGENDA! \n",

      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Very good bass &amp; well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\n",
      "2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)\n",
      "3. Very light weight\n",
      "4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\n",
      "5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &amp;iM716 have better isolation)\n",
      "6. Moderately priced ($50)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\n",
      "2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\n",
      "3. No pouch or case\n",

      "All in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it's physics, there's nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire.\n",
      "\n",
      "I paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\n",

      "I love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\n",

As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you're safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim's are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I've bought one every couple months and I'm on my 3rd spindle now.\n",

So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .

So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n",

The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it!

      "\n",
      "The sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \n",
      "i didn't give it five stars.\n",

You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.

This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it's worth that.

      "My experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \n",

      "I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n",
      " \n",
      "What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n",

Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn't be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3's, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won't cut it because XP ain't as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation.

      "I recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "The E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \n",

      "I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \n",

      "I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is.

      "First off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n",

      "As with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.

      "\n",
      "All in all, I'm very impressed so far, and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can't complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\n",

      "</review_text>, <review_text>\n",
      "I read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW! The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified\n",

      "For reference, I've owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend's ProMedia 4.1's (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500's which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021's which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they're probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\n",
      "\n",
      "Subwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It's very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn't have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don't sound right to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROs:\n",
      "* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\n",
      "* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\n",
      "* Power button on control pod\n",
      "* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they're on, not while they off. 100% silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONs:\n",
      "* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren't always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\n",
      "* Remote is a bit useless\n",
      "* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\n",
      "* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, don't be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn't matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn't pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\n",

      "COMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer's controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\n",

If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\n",

      "I recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \n",

I was a little hesitant at first because I don't think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\n",

      "I started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did\n",

      "This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of build, the EB's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all of the UE IEM's in this series, the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's, cord tangling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB's are well-designed and definitely fun\n",

One thing's for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven.

With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\n",

No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone's screen displays the time.\n",

I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin.

      "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",

      "The V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\n",

      "Each time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \n",

      "Whether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n",
      "\n",
      "It gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \n",

      "Before I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\n",

      "It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It's very simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn't fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I'm perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there's a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer's \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\n",

Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don't have a bulky protrusion when it's attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You'll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVD-RW or DVD+/- R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.

Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances.

      "When we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space). \n",

NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose, Harman Kardon, JBL, and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end, while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great, but are more expensive.

After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP, I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.

The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I'm just sitting too close.\n",

It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.\n",

I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n",

The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n",

      "There's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&amp;LOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVD-Audio discs.\" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVD-A's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A's, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you'll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\n",

If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\n",

      "Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\n",

Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.

I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\n",

Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows.

Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.

Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don't bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.

In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\n",

I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\n",

So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).

The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me.

In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \n",

Mind you I had paid like $200 for Sear's sorry 3-5 year? warranty and it turned out they wouldn't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there.  I heard a sickening crash (like the picture tube/glass breaking).  It still works and only has a dent it the top left.  I think I got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again.  Not a big deal since I have a directv remote,but I forgot I even had PIP because of no remote.  From now on if I can afford it I will buy sony only.  I bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that I never use\n",

      "This TV weighs a ton, took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire. I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27\" Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27\" Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36\" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound, but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire\n",

      "I agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!

      "My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead\n",

      "I purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. \n",

      "All 3 kids have a Tunebase.  It works great, easy to use.  It also charges the iPod while we travel\n",
      "</review_text>, <review_text>\n",
      "I've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They've included Koss \"The Plug,\" Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I've had to a good balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn't as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here's an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that's as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don't use these pads, so I don't think they're really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\n",

      "Overall, I'm satisified, especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way, don't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet!

      "I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!         \n",

      "There are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\n",
      "I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\n",
      "As a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don't work for or invest in them ;-\n",
      "</review_text>, <review_text>\n",
      "I bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I've owned the Sony MDR-V600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\n",

      "The Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bad: Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n",

      "Other Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close.

I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear.

The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it.

      "The KOSS Pro-4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's).  Also, they require a 1/4\"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators &amp; attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEGATIVES:\n",
      "1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones)\n",
      "2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size' is greater than 7 1/2.\n",
      "3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\n",
      "\n",
      "POSITIVES:\n",
      "1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA's is almost impossible to beat.\n",
      "2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\n",
      "3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\n",
      "4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA's for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they're not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.  If you just want 'jogging/exercise music', then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA's are still the best choice around.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it's single wire format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.\n",

      "Some notes on the contract:\n",
      "1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
      "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

It does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you're trapped in a building), AC, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\n",

The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\n",

      "The car mounting bracket works fine.  It's popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n",

      "The PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn't that intuitive, once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\n",

The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.\n",

      "I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \n",

      "It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n",

      "I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\n",

Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn't fail me out of the box. I've been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that's how well this gamepad has worked for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the ins and outs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I've never had it happen since. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Other buttons. \n",
      "* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n",
      "* The orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n",
      "* I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that's not much of a complaint at all, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "The d-pad itself is a godsend! I'm a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed - a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn't it? \n",

Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).

I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. \n",

Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive \"Pro\" paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the \"Pro\" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)\n",
